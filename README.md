# Projects

This is a short collection of projects which I have worked for fun on my free time. The purpose of these projects is to try out various technologies and learn on the go.


#### [Sudoku detector](webcam-sudoku/) from web camera

* Detection is running and updating in real-time on browsers, including mobile devices.
* Try the detector on your browser [here](webcam-sudoku/). Start the camera and point it to a Sudoku puzzle, for example, on your newspaper.
* Image processing, including Sudoku placement detection, blurring, and warping written in TypeScript.
* Digit recognition neural network trained with a small, custom-collected dataset with Keras / Tensorflow in python.
* Real-time digit recognition inference is done **in browser on the device** with tensorflow.js

An example of the Sudoku detector running on a mobile phone browser.

* The red rectangular area shows the detected Sudoku puzzle from the web camera image.
* The lower part shows the warped and segmented Sudoku puzzle with inferred digits with red and the numbers solving the puzzle with green.

#### Shortest path finding with A* or Dijkstra ([3D demo](a-star-vs-dijkstra-3d/), [2D demo](a-star-vs-dijkstra/))

* The A* and Dijkstra algorithm for the shortest path finding implemented in C++.
* Converted to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) toolchain.
* A [3D version](a-star-vs-dijkstra-3d) created using [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), targeting toward OpenGL ES 3.0.

* A humble [2D visualization](a-star-vs-dijkstra/) implemented with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

#### Drum chop tool

I enjoy playing drums (and guitar, too) a lot so I implemented a small rehearsal tool for myself to explore drum chops and polyrhythmic sequences in a web browser.

Try it out on your browser [here](drum-chops/).

* Written in TypeScript with React
* Using [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for sound synthesis


#### Step-by-step [Sudoku solver](scala-sudoku/)

* Written in Scala and running on web via [scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/)
* Shows individual steps for the solution.
* Try it out [here](scala-sudoku/index.html)

#### Haskell Sudoku step-by-step solver

I enjoy utilising functional programming concepts so I wrote a small command-line application for Sudoku puzzle solving using Haskell (a purely functional programming language).

* The source code is available on my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MattiRyynanen/haskell-sudoku)
* Using [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) for property-based testing
* Using [doctest](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest) for interactive testing
